                <div class = "paragraph"> The first time we were introduced to coding in the Arduino IDE, I understood that whatever was to be displayed on the screen would be in a loop. 
                    This made me want to think about what things go in a loop: instantly, my brain went to carousels at carnivals. I am personally very fond of carousels 
                    and carnivals, so I stuck with it. I created a PNG pixel art of a carousel horse and made it into a Sprite. Once I could make it go around the screen, I made it go up 
                    and down to imitate a horse on a carousel. I added two more horses to fill up the screen for a total of three horses in the loop.
                    <br> <br>
            
                    I wanted to incorporate a random element to my animation, so I displayed the words "HOP ON!" for 5 seconds, followed by the carousel horse loop playing 
                    for a random time between 5-10 seconds. </div>

                The code for the animation was developed in the Arduino IDE, and then uploaded to the ESP32's flash drive via a USB-C connection. 
                <br><br>

                Separately, 220mAH was soldered. Crimp connectors and heat wrap were used to create a connection from the battery to the ESP32. Once the ESP32 was 
                properly powered and attached to the battery, both components were taped to the back of the cardboard envelope, such that the display was visible out 
                of the cutout in its front. 

                <div class = "row media_row">

                </div>
                <br>

                Afterwards, the envelope was decorated with a red pen and hole punched. A piece of string was tied to a popsicle stick and attached through the hole punch in the envelope.

                <br>

                Using a ladder, the popsicle was inserted onto the ceiling vents. Since this installation included other artists, the envelope was dangling from the ceiling alongside many other envelopes 
                and animations. On the left is a video of myslef installing my work, while the right are all the other works from the installation.

                Since the displays are dangling from a string, they are all spinning. I had seen this happen with the prior year's installation and wished to incorporate that into my idea: not only
                do the horses go round and round in a loop, but the carousel itself is spinning, as they do in real life.

                I find carousels to be very reminiscent of my childhood, and something my mom loved to take us to when I was younger. One of the last times she came and visited New York we went on a carousel
                ride at Central Park. This made me want to incorporate a childish aspect to my design, which came across in my envelope drawing. Since I used a pen, it gives the appearance of 
                a crayon drawing done by a kid. It's whimsical and fun,
